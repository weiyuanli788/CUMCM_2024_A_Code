# CUMCM 2024: Problem A - Bench Loong

## Team Information
We are a team of three participants in the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM) 2024. This is our first time participating in the competition, and we chose **Problem A: Bench Loong**. 

### Team Roles:

Although we lack experience, we decided to make our work public, hoping to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement. We welcome any constructive criticism.

## Problem Description
The "Bench Loong" is a cultural activity involving benches arranged in a spiral, creating a dynamic and aesthetic performance. Our goal was to model the movement of the benches in different scenarios as described in **Problem A** of CUMCM 2024. The problem required us to simulate the motion of the benches along a spiral curve and solve several sub-problems related to the positioning, speed, and turning movements of the Bench Loong.

You can find the full description of the problem and its requirements in the attached PDF.

## Approach and Solution
We developed mathematical models and simulations for the following tasks:

1. **Problem 1**: Calculated the position and speed of the Bench Loong at different time intervals during its spiral motion.
2. **Problem 2**: Determined the termination time of the motion to avoid collisions between the benches.
3. **Problem 3**: Calculated the minimum pitch required for the Bench Loong to make a turn in a confined space.
4. **Problem 4**: Modeled the Bench Loong's transition between rotating inwards and outwards using an S-shaped curve.
5. **Problem 5**: Calculated the maximum speed of the head to ensure no part of the Bench Loong exceeds a speed of 2 m/s.
